	For autonomous quadruped robot navigation in various complex environments, 
	a typical SOTA (e.g. State Of The Art) system is composed of four main modules 
	-- mapper, global planner, local planner, and command-tracking controller -- 
	in a hierarchical manner. In this paper, we are particularly interested in building 
	a robust and safe local planner which is designed to generate a velocity plan to track a
	coarsely planned path from the global planner. Previous works used waypoint-based 
	methods (e.g. Proportional-Differential control, pure pursuit) which simplify the 
	path tracking problem to local point-goal navigation. However, they suffer from 
	frequent collisions in geometrically complex and narrow environments because of two 
	reasons; the global planner uses a coarse and inaccurate model and the local planner 
	is unable to track the global plan sufficiently well. Currently, deep learning methods 
	are an appealing alternative because they can learn safety and path feasibility from 
	experience more accurately. However, existing deep learning methods are not capable of 
	planning for a long horizon. In this work, we propose a learning-based fully autonomous 
	navigation framework composed of three innovative elements: a learned forward dynamics model 
	(FDM), an online sampling-based model-predictive controller, and an informed trajectory sampler 
	(ITS). Using our framework, a quadruped robot can autonomously navigate in various complex 
	environments without a collision and generate a smoother command plan compared to the 
	baseline method. Furthermore, our method can reactively handle unexpected obstacles on 
	the planned path and avoid them.
