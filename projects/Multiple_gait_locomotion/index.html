	There is a growing interest in learning a velocity command tracking controller of 
	quadruped robot using reinforcement learning due to its robustness and scalability. 
	However, a single policy, trained end-to-end, usually shows a single gait regardless 
	of the command velocity. This could be a suboptimal solution considering the existence 
	of optimal gait according to the velocity for quadruped animals. In this work, we propose 
	a hierarchical controller for quadruped robot that could generate multiple gaits 
	(i.e. pace, trot, bound) while tracking velocity command. Our controller is composed of two policies, 
	each working as a central pattern generator and local feedback controller, and trained with hierarchical 
	reinforcement learning. Experiment results show 1) the existence of optimal gait for specific velocity 
	range 2) the efficiency of our hierarchical controller compared to a controller composed of a single 
	policy, which usually shows a single gait. Codes are publicly available.
