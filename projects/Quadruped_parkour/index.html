	High-speed legged navigation in discrete and geometrically complex environments is a challenging task because of 
    the high–degree-of-freedom dynamics and long-horizon, nonconvex nature of the optimization problem. In this work, 
    we propose a hierarchical navigation pipeline for legged robots that can traverse such environments at high speed. 
    The proposed pipeline consists of a planner and tracker module. The planner module finds physically feasible 
    foothold plans by sampling-based optimization with fast sequential filtering using heuristics and a neural network. 
    Subsequently, rollouts are performed in a physics simulation to identify the best foothold plan regarding the 
    engineered cost function and to confirm its physical consistency. This hierarchical planning module is 
    computationally efficient and physically accurate at the same time. The tracker aims to accurately step on the 
    target footholds from the planning module. During the training stage, the foothold target distribution is given by 
    a generative model that is trained competitively with the tracker. This process ensures that the tracker is trained 
    in an environment with the desired difficulty. The resulting tracker can overcome terrains that are more difficult 
    than what the previous methods could manage. We demonstrated our approach using Raibo, our in-house dynamic 
    quadruped robot. The results were dynamic and agile motions: Raibo is capable of running on vertical walls, 
    jumping a 1.3-meter gap, running over stepping stones at 4 meters per second, and autonomously navigating on 
    terrains full of 30° ramps, stairs, and boxes of various sizes.
