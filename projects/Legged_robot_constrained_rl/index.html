	Several earlier studies have shown impressive control performance in complex robotic systems by designing 
    the controller using a neural network and training it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, 
    these outstanding controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed through 
    extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming process of designing numerous 
    reward terms and determining suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement 
    learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic systems consisting of both 
    rewards and constraints. To let the engineers appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle 
    them with minimal computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization algorithm 
    are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion controllers for several legged robots with 
    different morphology and physical attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and real-world 
    experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained with significantly less reward engineering, by 
    tuning only a single reward coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering process 
    can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of constraints.
